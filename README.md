A Ludum Dare 46 submission.

This code isn't very good, but some of it is alright I guess.
I was gonna write something sane at the start... but then as the compo went on I kinda stopped.

Other than that the you should be able to open the project with Visual Studio and compile it as all the dependencies are included.
